Our mission is to understand the molecular mechanisms that drive fertility and the early stages of embryo development and implantation in mammals. To achieve our goals, we are strongly committed to combining experimental, and systems genomics approaches to understand the dynamics of gene regulatory and signaling networks that orchestrate successful events related to fertility or infertility. Our efforts focus on three primary thrusts: 1) Molecular profiling of heifer infertility; 2) The acquisition of developmental competence in oocytes and the molecular signals of embryo survival; 3) Molecular communication between conceptus and endometrium.

## Molecular profiling of heifer infertility
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">
There are several causes infertility. In the Biase Lab, we are tackling the problem in heifers in beef and dairy cattle. Our multidisciplinary program aims at profiling blood born molecules for the comprehensive investigation of genetic and physiological alterations that contribute to infertility. Then, we employ artificial intelligence algorithms for the prediction of fertility heifers early as early as 6 months of age.

## The acquisition of developmental competence in oocytes

</p>
</div>


<div class = "col-md-6">
The female gamete stores massive amounts of RNAs, proteins and metabolites. The qualitative and quantitative composition of these stores define the ability of this oocyte to be fertilized and sustain the early embryo development. We are interested in understanding the regulatory venues that drive the synthesis of RNA in oocytes. Furthermore, we focus on unveiling how the accumulation of RNAs will contribute to the oocyte developmental competence.

## Early stages of mammalian development
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">
The initial cell cycles of the mammalian organisms are an intriguing, and amazing, phase of the development. The development of a complex multicellular organism from one cell (also called zygote) is far from being understood by developmental biologists. In our lab, we are researching the gene regulatory network wiring that allows the embryo to successfully reach the blastocyst stage. First, we are interested in understanding how the embryo’s genome is activated. Then, we are investigating how the cells (also called blastomeres) differentiate towards two distinct cell types, forming the inner cell mass and the trophectoderm.

## Conceptus-maternal communication
<div class = "row">
<div class = "col-md-6">
pict
</div>

<div class = "col-md-6">
 After the formation of blastocyst, the embryos hatch from the zona pelucida and the embryonic cells are in immediate contact with the endometrial cells in the uterus. Then, a two-way molecular communication takes place so that the embryo is not rejected by the endometrium and is nourished by the uterus. This communication is essential for the successful implantation and subsequent placentation. We are interested in finding the multitude of pathways the conceptus uses communicates with the endometrium and vice-versa.
